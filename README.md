It's not quite working yet, but there is a demo to get an idea of how it would work.

## Todo

### Planned

* Sync data to firebase for analytics
* Make a mode that limits you to 5 moves and you just try to get the top score in 5 moves
* Allow the user to put in their name when they beat the top score
* Save the top score to firebase
* Display the actual top score
* Check to see if there no more possible words
* Make the new game button work

### Design

* Move the letters down a tad
* Style the stats
* Add a new game button
* Show the path of your word

### Ideas

* Wild card tiles
* Scramble button to mix up the board
* Multi-player
* Ads
* Get it in the App Store
* A mode that counts each letter a different amount (for example, more points for Qu)
